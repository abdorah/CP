> This repository is my back yard in which I assemble a selection of compititve programming solutions and problems. Please feel free to enjoy playing and learning from these algorithms!

## Presentation

**These problems I assemble are a selection that I get baisaclly from `HackerRank`, `LeetCode`, and `CodeWars`  for which the solutions are implemented in `java 11` and/or `C`. To get a global sight of this repository you can use the following table of content. It consist of problems and the solution class name. Note that you will find also a simple test for the algorithm in an other class that takes the same name plus "Test" at end. Also, the problems will get a rating based on the time I spent trying to solve it and my humble point of vue.**
